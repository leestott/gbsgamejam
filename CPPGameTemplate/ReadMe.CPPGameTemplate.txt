Using Template: Marmalade C++ Game Project

This is a complete mini 3D C++ game engine that you can use to build your own 3D games. 
It provides a starting point for your own engine, although it provides enough features 
without modifications to enable you to create 3D games out of the box.

An example game has also been provided called MaxiCube, you can use this game as a 
starting point for your own game or use it as a reference.

Asset conversion tools for Mac and Windows have been provided in the tools folder. The 
FbxConverter will convert files exported by Maya LT to a format that the engine can work 
with. Assets have been provided with the example game and shell scripts have been 
provided that demonstrate how to convert your own assets

Documentation for the engine and example has been provided in the docs folder.
